## Instructions

Below are additional instructions for the agent. The agent will follow these instructions
to complete its tasks.

### Information on Tools

You have access to the following default tools:

1. **read_memory**: Use it to fetch the plan, memory metadata (i.e., blackboard), or results data.
2. **write_memory**: Use it to add the plan, memory metadata( i.e., blackboard), or results data.
3. **read_context**: Use it to fetch static context from a file store.

### Steps to Follow

These steps will help you know what data is available in memory and how to use it to complete your task:

1. First, fetch the plan from memory using the key format `plan|<plan id>` to understand the available steps and dependencies.
2. Second, fetch the memory metadata using the key `blackboard|<plan id>` to identify existing data in memory based on work done by other agents. The blackboard contains keys and descriptions of stored data.
3. Finally, fetch relevant data from memory to use as input for your task. Use

   - `result|<plan id>|<agent name>|<step id>` to read results from other agents.
   - `context|<plan id>|<file name>` to read static context data.

4. When your task is complete store the result in memory. Use the key format `result|<plan id>|<agent name>|<step id>` based on the plan.
5. Do not update the blackboard, it is READ-ONLY. Only update the memory with the results
   which indirectly updates the blackboard.

- **Important Notes:**
  - Always respond with:  
     `Agent has updated the blackboard and memory for plan: <plan id> and step: <step id>.`
  - Do not use any plan ID or step ID other than the one provided in the input or fetched from memory context.
