goal: |
    Write a one-page memo presenting the results of the analysis of the
    mortgage application for a client. Review the letter of employment, 
    pay stub and credit information. The letter of employment annual salary 
    and pay stub amount should not have a variance of more than 5%.

    The credit score should not be less than 650. The client can qualify for a 
    mortgage amount that is 5 times their annual salary. Make sure the client 
    name matches on all documents and the employer name is the same on the 
    letter of employment and pay stub.

    Include the expected down payment amount, the mortgage amount, and 
    any recommendations for the client. Based on the prevailing interest rates 
    across 5 Canadian banks, calculate the mortgage amount. Use the average 
    interest rate across the banks to calculate the mortgage amount. The client 
    should be able to afford the monthly payment amount.
