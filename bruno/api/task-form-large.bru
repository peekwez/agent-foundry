  goal: '''
    Write a one-page memo presenting the results of the analysis of the
    mortgage application for a client. Review the letter of employment,
    pay stub and credit information. The letter of employment annual salary
    and pay stub amount should not have a variance of more than 5%.

    The credit score should not be less than 650. The client can qualify for a
    mortgage amount that is equivalent to 5 times their annual gross salary.

    The memo should comment on the consistency of the employer and employer names
    on the letter of employment and pay stub.

    Include the expected down payment amount (i.e., 5-20%), the mortgage amount,
    and any recommendations for the client. Use the average prevailing interest
    rate across the big 4 Canadian banks to estimate the monthly mortgage payments.
    The client should be able to afford the monthly payment amount.

    First time home buyers can make 5% down payment. If the mortgage
    amount is $1,000,000 or more the client is expected to make a 20% down payment.

    The memo should be addressed to the credit manager, and must include the
    client name, mortgage amount, down payment, and monthly payment amount.
    Include any additional recommendations.
